## Critique My Performance

### Critique My Performance is the final application built for Bloc, the web development program I'm in. It's a web application for musicians built using React and Firebase. Members can post YouTube or SoundCloud iframes of musical performances or practice sessions and receive critique from other members.

[Here is a link to the application](http://critiquemyperformance.herokuapp.com).
